{"prompt": "# Review and Improvement Request for FSM RTL\n\nI have a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** RTL module located at `rtl/fsm.sv` that currently implements **statically encoded** state logic. I would like to convert it to a **dynamically encoded** FSM. Below is a summary of the current design, a clear set of modifications to be made, and the evaluation criteria.\n\n---\n\n## Module Specifications\n\n### RTL (rtl/fsm.sv)\n\n**Inputs**:\n- **clk:** Posedge Clock signal.\n- **reset:** Active-high reset. When ACTIVE HIGH, the `state`, `current_state`, and `error_flag` are initialized to zero.\n- **input_signal:** A 4\u2011bit signal used to drive state transitions.\n- **config_state_map_flat:** A 64\u2011bit flattened state map that holds an 8\u2011bit configuration for each of the 8 states.\n- **config_transition_map_flat:** A 128\u2011bit flattened transition map for calculating the next state.\n\n**Outputs (Static FSM)**:\n- **current_state:** The current internal state (directly driven by the state register).\n- **error_flag:** Indicates if an invalid state transition (next state > 7) is detected.\n- **operation_result:** A result computed based on the current state and input signal using a user-defined operation.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Modifications for Dynamic State Encoding\n\nThe current design outputs the internal state directly, which is suitable for static state encoding. To improve flexibility and allow run-time reconfiguration for area and power optimizations, the following modifications are proposed:\n\n1. **Decouple Internal and External State Representation:**\n   - **Current Behavior:** The internal state is directly output as `current_state`.\n   - **Modification:** Remove the direct assignment and instead implement a lookup mechanism using `config_state_map_flat` to generate an **encoded_state**. This separates the internal binary state from its external representation.\n\n2. **Implement Additional Dynamic Transformation:**\n   - **Current Behavior:** Operations are computed directly using the statically encoded state.\n   - **Modification:** Introduce a second output called **dynamic_encoded_state** that is derived from the **encoded_state** using an additional transformation (for example, an XOR with the input signal). This extra transformation enables further flexibility in the external representation and can be tuned at run time.\n\n3. **Preserve Transition and Error Handling Logic:**\n   - **Current Behavior:** The next state is computed from the transition map, and error detection is performed if the next state exceeds 7.\n   - **Modification:** Retain this state transition logic, error detection, and the user-defined operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, bitwise operations) so that the functional behavior remains consistent.\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nTo evaluate the dynamic FSM against the current static design, consider the following criteria:\n\n- **Functional Correctness:**\n  - The dynamic FSM must maintain the same state transitions and operation results as the static FSM for identical inputs.\n  \n- **Reconfigurability:**\n  - The external state outputs (**encoded_state** and **dynamic_encoded_state**) must accurately reflect the configuration provided by `config_state_map_flat` and adapt correctly based on the input signal.\n\n- **Error Detection:**\n  - The error flag must be correctly set when the computed next state exceeds the valid range (i.e., greater than 7), and the state should be safely reset to 0 as in the original design.\n\n- **Flexibility:**\n  - The modifications should allow for on-the-fly changes to the state encoding without impacting the underlying state machine functionality. \n\n----\n**Block Diagram for the Existing Architecture**:\n\n                     +---------------------------+\n                     |

Implementation)**:  \n- Directly outputs the internal state as `current_state`.  \n- Uses fixed, unmodifiable state encoding.\n\n**Dynamic FSM (Proposed Improvement)**:  \n- Separates the internal state from its external representation using a configurable state map to generate **encoded_state**.  \n- Further refines the external state via a dynamic transformation (e.g., XOR with the input) to produce **dynamic_encoded_state**.  \n- Retains the same state transition, operation, and error detection logic.\n\nPlease review the current FSM implementation at `rtl/fsm.sv` and make the above modifications to convert the statically encoded design into a dynamically encoded FSM. The evaluation will be based on functional equivalence, improved flexibility in state representation, robust error handling, and the ability to adjust state encoding dynamically at runtime.\n"}
